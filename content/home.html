<p> Howdy!! My name is Wenlong Yuan. I am a postdoc fellow at the Department of Physics & Astronomy, Johns Hopkins University. I am actively applying for research scientist or faculty or service positions in the area of time-domain astronomy, photometric surveys, extragalactic distance calibration & observational cosmology, or related fields. For more details about my background, please visit the  <a class='inter_link' onclick='go_cv()'> CV section</a>. </p><br>

<p> I received Ph.D degree in 2017 from Texas A&M University (advisor: Lucas Macri). My Ph.D thesis focuses on the extragalactic distance scale calibration using two types of variable stars: Cepheids and Miras. For more details about my thesis or research, please click the <a class='inter_link' onclick='go_research()'> Research link</a>. </p><br>

<p> I love coding and mathematical/statistical methods, which in return facilitates my research. For example, I developed a PHP-based web application for visual classification, which significantly increased the efficiency of variable star selection. Although mainly working with R and Python, I have tried many languages like <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016zndo....154628H/abstract">C++</a>, IDL, PHP, <a class='inter_link' onclick='go_tools()'>javascript</a>, HTML, Fortran, etc. For mathematical/statistical methods, I applied methods like Gaussian process, Random Forest classification, linear regression, principal component analysis (PCA), etc. to my astronomical researches. </p>
